# CSCA 5632 Unsupervised Algorithms in ML - Final Project - True or Fake News Classification

### Overview

In this project, We'll build ML models to detect whether a news article is fake or real based on the content of the article using supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. We'll aim to achieve the highest possible prediction accuracy score.

### About the Dataset

We will be using the  **[fake-and-real-news-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)** which is available for download from Kaggle. The dataset is provided under the [Creative Commons 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.

The dataset consists of two files:

- Fake.csv (23,502 fake news article)
- True.csv (21,417 true news article)

Dataset columns:

- Title: title of news article  
- Text: body text of news article  
- Subject: subject of news article  
- Date: publish date of news article

Summary of Tasks:
- Importing libraries
